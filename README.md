AggiePark
=========

- Android app that allows users to interactively find out where and when they can park at Texas A&M University. Whoop!
- The idea came out of knowing some people that didn't know where they could park with some of the permits they had
- I designed maps using Mapbox Editor and linked each url of a map to a ListView item on the app to provide users with views/information about where they could park
- I was going for a better user experience by providing users with interactive maps that contained text boxes and markers
